How do you create a stack from a queue (in words)?
- stack can be implemented using two queues

given a queue data structure that supports standard operations like enqueue() and dequeue(), 
the task is to implement a stack data structure using only instances of Queue and Queue operations 

idea:
this way works by making the push() operation costly (O(N)) while the pop() operation is O(1)

keep the newly entered element at the front of q1 so that pop dequeues from q1
q2 is used to put every new element at the front of q1 

the steps to implement the push operation O(n)
- enqueue x to q2
- one by one, dequeue everything from q2 and enqueue to q2
- swap the elements of q1 and q2 

pop operation O(1)
- dequeue an element from q1 and return 


How do you create a queue from stack (in words)?
- queue can be implemented using two stacks

given a stack data structure with push and pop operations, the task is to implement
a queue using instances of stack data stuctures and operations 

idea:
the way this works is making the enqueue() operation costly (O(N)) while the dequeue operation is O(1)

ensures that the oldest entered element is always at the top of stack 1, so that dequeue just pops from stack 1
- use stack2 to put the element at the top of stack1

the steps to implement the enqueue operation O(n)
- while stack1 is not empty, push everything from stack 1 to stack 2
- push x to stack 1
- push everything back to stack 1

dequeue operation O(1)
- if stack 1 is empty then error 
- else pop an item from stack 1 and return it
